# Kronecker-Wmatrix
Kronecker product Method for Formulation Spatial Neighbor Matrices.

In this project we use our paper, "Fundamental Review on the Formulation of Large Lattice Spatial Neighbor Matrices" as referrences
for the R code.

The earlier R code version which referred to the Paper is named as "Kronecker W Matrix v1.R". This version focused on nearest neighbor
case searching method on W Matrices. However, in the second version of the code, "Kronecker W Matrix v1.R", we make the general case
code for the formulation of W matrices.
